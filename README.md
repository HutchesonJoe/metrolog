# METROlog

## Description

METROlog is an application which logs and tracks tenant complaints for a property management company in New York City -- built with a React frontend and Rails
backend, and deployed to Heroku. This application works now on a small scale with seven properties, but can easily be expanded to accommodate more. 

## Functions

  * Tenants
    - create an account.
    - file a building complaint.
    - edit a building complaint.
    - delete a building complaint for their unit. 
  * Superintendent
    - create an account.
    - register as a superintendent for a building. 
    - leave notes on a tenant compmlaint. 
    - view complaints by type or by building. 

METROlog also incorporate the Google Maps API, which shows a map of Manhattan with markers for each property in the company's portfolio. The interactive map shows the number of units and the number of filed complaints for each apartment.

  * Email correspondence between supers and tenants.
